At Deep Dish Swift, we're not only here to talk Swift, but to also serve pizza!
Think your code's got the secret sauce? Let's see what you've got.

We're cooking up a native Mac code editor called [CodeEdit](https://github.com/CodeEditApp/CodeEdit) (you may have heard of it), and if you contribute, we'll send you a pizza ‚Äî no strings attached, except for cheese.

Make a pull request, climb the leaderboard, claim your pie. Let's get saucy!

## Rules

Here's how to claim your slice:

1. Comment "I'll take this slice! üçï" on any issue in [our repos](https://github.com/CodeEditApp) on GitHub.
2. Make a PR solving that issue.
3. Email your name, GitHub username, a link to your merged PR to [codeforpizza@codeedit.app](mailto:codeforpizza@codeedit.app), along with your preferred pizza delivery service.

Once your PR is merged and you've sent us an email, we'll send you a digital gift card to order a pizza ‚Äî on us.

Hurry, this won't last long, [get started](https://github.com/CodeEditApp/CodeEdit/issues)!

> We reserve the right to only reward completed and meaningful contributions (but we'll still love you for trying).
