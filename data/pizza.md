At Deep Dish Swift, we're not only here to talk Swift, but to also serve pizza!
Think your code's got the secret sauce? Let's see what you've got.

We're cooking up a native Mac code editor called [CodeEdit](https://github.com/CodeEditApp/CodeEdit) (you may have heard of it), and if you toss up some code, we'll toss you a pizza ‚Äî no strings attached, except for cheese.

Make a pull request, climb the leaderboard, claim your pie. Let's get saucy!

## Rules

Here's how to claim your pie:
