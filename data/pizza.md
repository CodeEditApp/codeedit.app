At Deep Dish Swift, we're not only here to talk Swift, but to also serve pizza!
Think your code's got the secret sauce? Let's see what you've got.

We're cooking up a code editor for the Mac called <a href="https://github.com/CodeEditApp/CodeEdit" target="_blank">CodeEdit</a> (you may have heard of it) built entirely in Swift, and if you toss up some code, we'll toss you a pizza ‚Äî no strings attached, except for cheese.
