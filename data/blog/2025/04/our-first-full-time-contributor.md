We’re excited to share a milestone moment in CodeEdit’s journey:  
For the first time, we’ve brought on a **full-time contributor** to work on the project.

Thanks to the steady support from our sponsors over the past few years, we’ve been able to bring on [**Khan Winter**](https://github.com/thecoolwinter), one of our most dedicated and impactful contributors, to focus full-time on development for a limited period.

This is a big deal for us.

CodeEdit has always been a passion-driven, community-built project. Everyone involved has juggled this work alongside full-time jobs, school, and life. So having someone dedicated full-time — even just for a few months — means we can finally move at the kind of pace we’ve been dreaming about. It’s a chance to fix long-standing issues, polish key features, and make meaningful progress toward a 1.0 release.

## Our Development Strategy

To make the most of this focused time, we’ve laid out a [**prioritized roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/CodeEditApp/projects/3). The roadmap is broken down into clearly defined phases, with top-priority items at the top of each phase.

Khan’s approach is simple:

- **Pick the highest priority item in the current phase**
- **Knock it out**
- **Repeat until the phase is complete**
- **Then move on to the next phase**

He will also be posting **daily progress updates** and sharing **weekly progress updates** at our community meetup held every Saturday at 3pm UTC (join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vChUXVf9Em) to attend).

This rhythm helps us stay focused, get feedback early, and iterate quickly.

## A Note from Khan

## Get Involved

This full-time window won’t last forever — we have a limited runway, and we want to make the most of it. That’s why we’re inviting you to get involved in whatever way makes sense for you:

- 💙 **Sponsor CodeEdit** – Help us extend this full-time effort  
- 💻 **Contribute** – Join the dev conversation, submit a PR, or help with docs  
- 🗣️ **Join our community** – Hang out in Discord, join the weekly meetup, share your feedback

We believe CodeEdit can become the default code editor for macOS — fast, beautiful, open source, and built with care for the platform and community it serves.

This is a step in that direction.  
Thanks for being part of it.
