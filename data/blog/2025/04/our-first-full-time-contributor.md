We’re excited to share a milestone moment in CodeEdit’s journey:  
For the first time, we’ve brought on a **full-time contributor** to work on the project.

Thanks to the steady support from our sponsors over the past few years, we’ve been able to bring on [**Khan Winter**](https://github.com/thecoolwinter), one of our most dedicated and impactful contributors, to focus full-time on development for a limited period.

This is a big deal for us.

CodeEdit has always been a passion-driven, community-built project. Everyone involved has juggled this work alongside full-time jobs, school, and life. So having someone dedicated full-time — even just for a few months — means we can finally move at the kind of pace we’ve been dreaming about. It’s a chance to fix long-standing issues, polish key features, and make meaningful progress toward a 1.0 release.

## Our Development Strategy

To make the most of this focused time, we’ve laid out a [**prioritized roadmap**](https://github.com/orgs/CodeEditApp/projects/3). The roadmap is broken down into clearly defined phases, with top-priority items at the top of each phase.

Khan’s approach is simple:

- **Pick the highest priority item in the current phase**
- **Knock it out**
- **Repeat until the phase is complete**
- **Then move on to the next phase**

He will also be posting **daily progress updates** and sharing **weekly progress updates** at our community meetup held every Saturday at 3pm UTC (join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vChUXVf9Em) to attend).

This rhythm helps us stay focused, get feedback early, and iterate quickly.

## A Message from Khan

> Hello everyone. My name is Khan Winter and I'm grateful and delighted to have the opportunity to work on CodeEdit full time.
> 
> I've been developing for Apple platforms for about six years and for three of those years I've been working on CodeEdit. CodeEdit excited me when I first came across the GitHub page. I saw a macOS editor that wasn't based on Electron and felt right at home on my Mac. It was my dream editor.
> 
> Once I saw I wasn't finished and had a lot to get done, I was excited to start contributing. I soon discovered a passion for this project that has stayed with me to this very day, volunteering hundreds of hours of my time towards this project.
> 
> I've worked closely on our Swift TextView package, our editor package, and coded its file management system, along with numerous other bug fixes and performance improvements throughout the app.
> 
> Since becoming a maintainer, I've constantly wished that I could put more time and energy towards developing what myself and other maintainers think this application could be. I'm excited to the opportunity to do exactly that. And we'll be putting my utmost effort towards this while I have the chance.
> 
> I'm looking forward to knocking out the features that we still have in our roadmap. I'll be looking to bring code edit to what we consider viable for a version one release that includes smoothing out our most basic editing interactions from copy paste to multi-line editing. It also includes things like language server integration. So all of your favorite languages support a best in class editing experience.
> 
> I'm thrilled to get started. I want to thank our generous and wonderful sponsors  who have made this all possible. None of this would happen without your generosity. I'm looking forward to continuing to collaborate with this wonderful community. I'm excited to see what we can get done.

## Get Involved

This full-time window won’t last forever — we have a limited runway, and we want to make the most of it. That’s why we’re inviting you to get involved in whatever way makes sense for you:

- 💙 **Sponsor CodeEdit** – Help us extend this full-time effort  
- 💻 **Contribute** – Join the dev conversation, submit a PR, or help with docs  
- 🗣️ **Join our community** – Hang out in Discord, join the weekly meetup, share your feedback

We believe CodeEdit can become the default code editor for macOS — fast, beautiful, open source, and built with care for the platform and community it serves.

This is a step in that direction.  
Thanks for being part of it.
