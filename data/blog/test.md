### More code

```python
def dump_args(func):
    "This decorator dumps out the arguments passed to a function before calling it"
    argnames = func.func_code.co_varnames[:func.func_code.co_argcount]
    fname = func.func_name
    def echo_func(*args,**kwargs):
        print fname, ":", ', '.join(
            '%s=%r' % entry
            for entry in zip(argnames,args) + kwargs.items())
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return echo_func

@dump_args
def f1(a,b,c):
    print a + b + c

f1(1, 2, 3)

def precondition(precondition, use_conditions=DEFAULT_ON):
    return conditions(precondition, None, use_conditions)

def postcondition(postcondition, use_conditions=DEFAULT_ON):
    return conditions(None, postcondition, use_conditions)

class conditions(object):
    __slots__ = ('__precondition', '__postcondition')

    def __init__(self, pre, post, use_conditions=DEFAULT_ON):
        if not use_conditions:
            pre, post = None, None

        self.__precondition  = pre
        self.__postcondition = post
```


Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
