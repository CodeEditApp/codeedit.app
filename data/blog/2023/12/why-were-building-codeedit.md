In an era where most code editors rely on cross-platform frameworks like Electron or the JVM, there's a significant gap in the market for a truly native macOS code editing experience. We aim to fill that gap. It's more than just another code editor; it's a movement, a community-driven project aiming to revolutionize the way developers interact with their code on macOS.

## The Limitations of Current Code Editors

Today's popular code editors, although functional, often fall short in fully leveraging the capabilities of macOS. They tend to be built on frameworks designed for cross-platform compatibility, which can limit their performance and integration with powerful macOS frameworks. While Xcode does provide a native experience, it's tailored specifically for Apple platform development, leaving a void for those working on projects outside of this ecosystem or in support of it.

## Introducing CodeEdit: A macOS-Native Solution

CodeEdit is our answer to this gap. It's not just an application; it's a concept turned reality, born from the question, "What if there was an editor that could harness the full potential of macOS for all developers?" Our goal is to offer the macOS-native experience that developers deserve, regardless of the platform they are developing for.

## Features Tailored for macOS

CodeEdit is built exclusively for macOS, ensuring seamless integration and optimization. Our features include:

- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Project find and replace
- Snippets
- Integrated terminal
- Task running and debugging
- Git integration and code review
- Extensions 
- and more...

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of writing, not all of these features are built. That is where you come in.

## Community-Driven, Open Source, and Free

At the heart of CodeEdit is our community. We are committed to keeping CodeEdit open source and free forever. We believe in the power of community-led projects and welcome contributions from everyone.

## The Power of Community in Building CodeEdit

One of the most defining aspects of CodeEdit is its roots in the community. This approach has significant advantages, shaping not only the development process but also the very essence of the application. Here's how building CodeEdit with the community is setting new standards in software development.

### Rapid Development and Iteration

In a community-driven project, the development cycle is incredibly dynamic. We can build, iterate, and refine features much faster than in a traditional setup. This agility allows us to quickly adapt to new ideas and feedback, ensuring that CodeEdit evolves in a way that consistently meets the needs of its users.

### Independence and Diversity of Thought

Unlike projects dictated by company directors or a specific set of stakeholders, CodeEdit benefits from a diverse range of ideas and perspectives. This independence means we're not limited by a single company's vision or agenda. Instead, we can explore creative solutions and innovative features that a more corporate-driven project might overlook.

### Amplified Feedback and Collaboration

With a broader community of users and contributors, we have access to a more extensive feedback pool. This diverse input is crucial in identifying and fixing issues quickly, enhancing usability, and ensuring that the editor meets a wide range of developer needs.

### Democratic Decision-Making

Every major change, feature, or improvement in CodeEdit is subject to community review and approval. This democratic approach ensures that the developments in the editor are not only technically sound but also genuinely desired by its user base. It's a process that values every voice in the community, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement among all contributors.

## The Benefits of a Native macOS Code Editor

### Unmatched Performance

By utilizing macOS's native capabilities, CodeEdit offers a level of performance that cross-platform editors can't match. This means faster load times, smoother operation, and better resource management.

### A Familiar, Intuitive Interface

Staying true to Apple's human interface guidelines, CodeEdit provides an environment that feels intuitive and familiar to macOS users. It's designed to feel like an extension of the macOS ecosystem, not just another third-party application.

The intention is to help developers stay focused and connected to the code being written by building an application where the UI simply melts into the background. The best UI is invisible and we think that conforming to the design patterns Apple has put into place, we can achieve just that.

### Scalability and Flexibility

From lightweight text editing to handling complex development tasks, CodeEdit is scalable. It combines the simplicity of TextEdit with the power of Xcode, ensuring a flexible environment that adapts to your needs.

## The Origin Story of CodeEdit: From Frustration to Innovation

In the world of software development, necessity is often the mother of invention. This is precisely the case with CodeEdit, a project that began not in a boardroom, but from a developer's personal challenge and a vision for something better. Here's how this groundbreaking idea came to life.

### The Genesis: A Personal Project Born From Frustration with Existing Tools

My journey with CodeEdit started as a personal quest to enhance my coding experience on macOS. Like many developers, I began by customizing VS Code, trying to give it a macOS-native feel. This involved writing custom CSS and applying it to VS Code after each update. However, this was far from a perfect solution and by no means scalable.

The limitations of VS Code became increasingly apparent. I encountered hangs, crashes, and various performance issues that interrupted my workflow. These frustrations led me to a pivotal question: If I were to design a code editor from scratch, specifically for macOS, what would it look like?

### The Leap: From Mockups to Movement

This question didn't remain hypothetical for long. I started experimenting with designs in Figma, initially creating a few mockups. These mockups rapidly evolved into a comprehensive user flow comprising 20-30 designs. The more I designed, the more the vision of a native macOS code editor took shape.

I couldn't keep these ideas to myself. I shared my designs on social media, sparking a conversation about the need for a more general-purpose code editor for macOS. The underlying thought was simple yet powerful: If Microsoft could create something as successful as VS Code, why couldn't Apple—or the community—craft a native macOS code editor?

### Building Momentum: From Social Media to Open Source Phenomenon

Despite reaching out to several Xcode engineers at Apple and learning that direct assistance wasn't forthcoming, I was encouraged to embark on an open-source journey. This challenge was daunting, especially as a JavaScript developer new to Swift. Nevertheless, I was determined to give it a shot.

I started with a simple "Hello World" application resembling a code editor's layout. Accompanied by a readme explaining our goals and mission, this humble beginning was the seed that would grow into something much larger.

When I shared the repository on social media, the response was overwhelming. The project resonated with the developer community, amassing over 5,000 stars in just a few weeks. Contributions started flowing in, with developers from around the world submitting pull requests.

Now, CodeEdit stands as one of the most starred repositories written in Swift on GitHub. Our journey from a set of Figma mockups to a community-driven open-source project exemplifies the power of collaboration and shared vision.

## The Future is Bright

As CodeEdit continues to evolve, we're more committed than ever to our mission. We're not just building a code editor; we're creating a community, a movement, a new way of experiencing code editing on macOS. With the support and contributions of our growing community, the possibilities are endless.

## Join the Revolution

CodeEdit represents more than just a tool; it's a vision for a more integrated, efficient, and enjoyable coding experience on macOS, set forth not just by me, but by the entire community.

Join us in this exciting journey. Whether you're a developer, a designer, or simply someone who believes in the power of open-source software, there's a place for you in the CodeEdit community. Together, we're not just writing code; we're writing history.
